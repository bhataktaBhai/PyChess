Algebraic notation has some room for personal comments as well.
The characters '!' and '?' may be added to the end of a move to show if it is a good or bad move.
    !  :  Great Move
    !! :  Excellent move
    ?  :  Mistake
    ?? :  Blunder
    !? :  Interesting but risky move
    ?! :  Dubious move
In the earlier example, Qc8+ could be written as
    Qc8+??
